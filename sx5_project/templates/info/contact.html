        <h2>Classification Calculation</h2>
        <h3>Calculation Rules</h3>
        <p>
            Runners will be allocated points after each race, based on their general position, position in their gender category, 
            and position in their age category. The runner who finished 1st in a given category will be allocated 1 point, 
            the runner who finished 2nd will be allocated 2 points, etc. Runners need to take part in at least 5 out of 6 races to be included in 
            the final classification. If a runner takes part in all 6 races, their best 5 results will be used when calculating the overall classification result. 
            Classification results are available from the 3rd race onwards. For a runner that has taken part in all races at any given point, the
            worst result will be removed when calculating the overall classification result.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario 1: Consistent Participation with Varied Results</h3>
        <p>
            Races Participated: Alex runs in all 6 races.<br>
            Race Results:<br>
            Race 1: 3rd overall.<br>
            Race 2: 5th overall.<br>
            Race 3: 4th overall.<br>
            Race 4: 2nd overall.<br>
            Race 5: 6th overall.<br>
            Race 6: 1st overall.<br>
            Points Calculation: Alex's worst result (6th in Race 5) is dropped. Points from the best 5 races are:<br>
            Total = 3 (Race 1) + 5 (Race 2) + 4 (Race 3) + 2 (Race 4) + 1 (Race 6) = 15 points.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario 2: Minimum Participation</h3>
        <p>
            Races Participated: Alex only runs in 5 races.<br>
            Race Results:<br>
            Race 1: 2nd overall.<br>
            Race 2: Did not participate.<br>
            Race 3: 3rd overall.<br>
            Race 4: 4th overall.<br>
            Race 5: 1st overall.<br>
            Race 6: 5th overall.<br>
            Points Calculation: Since Alex ran only 5 races, points from all these races are counted:<br>
            Total = 2 (Race 1) + 3 (Race 3) + 4 (Race 4) + 1 (Race 5) + 5 (Race 6) = 15 points.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario 3: High Participation with One Poor Result</h3>
        <p>
            Races Participated: Alex runs in all 6 races.<br>
            Race Results:<br>
            Race 1: 1st overall.<br>
            Race 2: 2nd overall.<br>
            Race 3: 3rd overall.<br>
            Race 4: 10th overall (poor performance).<br>
            Race 5: 4th overall.<br>
            Race 6: 2nd overall.<br>
            Points Calculation: Alex's worst result (10th in Race 4) is dropped. Points from the best 5 races are:<br>
            Total = 1 (Race 1) + 2 (Race 2) + 3 (Race 3) + 4 (Race 5) + 2 (Race 6) = 12 points.
