# South by Five Running Race Series Project

## Overview

The project's main goal is to manage a running race series consisting of six races and to calculate a general classification based on runners' performances across all races.

## Features

### Race Participation
- Runners can participate in a series of six races. 
- To qualify for the final general classification, a runner must participate in a minimum of five races.

### Points System
- Positions determine points: first place gets 1 point, second place gets 2 points, etc.
- Fewer points mean higher rank in the general classification.
- If two runners have an equal number of points, the one who participated in more races ranks higher.

### Data Management
- After each race, an Excel file containing race results is uploaded. 
- The file includes each runner's time and their category.
- The system processes the race results and calculates runners' positions based on their times.

### Adjusted Results
- Starting from the third race, an adjusted copy of previous race results is created.
